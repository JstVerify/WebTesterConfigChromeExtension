## WebTester Config Generator - Chrome Extension
 
This application is intended to ease the creation of WebTest configurations.
 
### Usage:
 
Once installed, this extension will give you the ability to record a WebTest configuration simply by interacting with your website or web based application as you would normally. For ease of use, the extension will highlight the web element the mouse pointer is hovering over. The highlight feature can be disabled in the extension options. Simply right-click the extension icon and click options to disable it.
 
### Limitations:
 
This extension is provided as is and may not be fully compatible with your site or web based application. As a result you should always preview the created configuration after uploading via the JstVerify WebTester Dashboard.
Any issues discovered could be manually corrected at that time.
 
This Chrome extension works by analyzing mouse clicks on the screen and as a result tabbing through form fields will not work.
